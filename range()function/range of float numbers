The Python range() works only with integers. It doesnâ€™t support the float type, i.e., we cannot use floating-point/decimal value in any of its arguments.

For example,
If you use range() with float step argument, you will get a TypeError 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer.

for i in range(0, 1, 0.1):
    print(i)
# Output TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
