Local Variable in function
A local variable is a variable declared inside the function that is not accessible from outside of the function. The scope of the local variable is limited to that function only where it is declared.

If we try to access the local variable from the outside of the function, we will get the error as NameError.



Example

def function1():
    # local variable
    loc_var = 888
    print("Value is :", loc_var)

def function2():

    print("Value is :", loc_var)

function1()
function2()
 

Output

Value is : 888
print("Value is :", loc_var) # gives error,
NameError: name 'loc_var' is not defined




====>Global Variable in function=====>:

A Global variable is a variable that declares outside of the function. The scope of a global variable is broad. It is accessible in all functions of the same module.

Example

global_var = 999
def function1():
    print("Value in 1nd function :", global_var)
def function2():
    print("Value in 2nd function :", global_var)

function1()
function2()
 
Output:

Value in 1nd function : 999
Value in 2nd function : 999

Global Keyword in Function
In Python, global is the keyword used to access the actual global variable from outside the function. we use the global keyword for two purposes:

===>To declare a global variable inside the function==================


Declaring a variable as global, which makes it available to function to perform the modification.
Let’s see what happens when we don’t use global keyword to access the global variable in the function



# Global variable
global_var = 5
def function1():
    print("Value in 1st function :", global_var)

def function2():
    # Modify global variable
    # function will treat it as a local variable
    global_var = 555
    print("Value in 2nd function :", global_var)

def function3():
    print("Value in 3rd function :", global_var)

function1(
function2()
function3()
 
Output:
Value in 1st function : 5
Value in 2nd function : 555
Value in 3rd function : 5
As you can see, function2() treated global_var as a new variable (local variable). To solve such issues or access/modify global variables inside a function, we use the global keyword.






Example:

# Global variable
x = 5

# defining 1st function
def function1():
    print("Value in 1st function :", x)

# defining 2nd function
def function2():
    # Modify global variable using global keyword
    global x
    x = 555
    print("Value in 2nd function :", x)
    # defining 3rd function
def function3():
    print("Value in 3rd function :", x)
function1()
function2()
function3()
 
Output

Value in 1st function : 5
Value in 2nd function : 555
Value in 3rd function : 555
